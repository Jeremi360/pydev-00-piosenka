Turn to run
Now look what it's become
Outnumbered ten to one
Back then should've bit your tongue
'Cause there’s no turning back this path once it’s begun
You’re already on that list
Say you don’t want what you can't resist
Waving that sword when the pen won’t miss
Watch it all falling apart like this

This is what you asked for
Heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise
Ashes raining down
Try to hold it in but
It keeps bleeding out
This is what you asked for
Heavy is the, Heavy is the crown

Today’s gonna be the day you notice
Cause I’m tired of explaining what the joke is
THIS IS WHAT YOU ASKED FOR

This is what you asked for
Heavy is the crown
Fire in the sunrise
Ashes raining down
Try to hold it in but
It keeps bleeding out
This is what you asked for
Heavy is the, Heavy is the crown
Heavy is the crown
Heavy is the, Heavy is the crown
