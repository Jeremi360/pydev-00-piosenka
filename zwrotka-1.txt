It's pouring in
You’re laid on the floor again
One knock at the door and then
We both know how the story ends
You can’t win if your white flag’s out when the war begins
Aiming so high but swinging so low
Trying to catch fire but feeling so cold
Hold it inside and hope it won’t show
I’m saying it’s not but inside I know
