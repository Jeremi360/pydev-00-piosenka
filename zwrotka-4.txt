Turn to run
Now look what it's become
Outnumbered ten to one
Back then should've bit your tongue
'Cause there’s no turning back this path once it’s begun
You’re already on that list
Say you don’t want what you can't resist
Waving that sword when the pen won’t miss
Watch it all falling apart like this
